# Digital Twin for Marketing Concept Evaluation

This project implements a **Digital Twin system** for evaluating marketing concepts using machine learning clustering and persona-based analysis. The system creates user personas from interaction data and predicts how different user segments would respond to new marketing concepts.

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

The Digital Twin system uses **K-means clustering** to segment users into personas based on their interaction patterns, then evaluates marketing concepts against these personas to predict engagement and response rates.

### Key Features
- **Persona Creation**: Automatically clusters users into distinct personas using interaction data
- **Concept Evaluation**: Scores marketing concepts based on persona preferences
- **Demographic Alignment**: Considers age groups and user demographics in evaluation
- **Response Prediction**: Predicts "yes", "maybe", or "no" responses with reasoning
